  I am admittedly the jumpy sort, so maybe the bar was low, but this AI-created
  trailer for upcoming sci-fi thriller definitely sent chills up my spine. And
  this is the ultimate troll because Morgan is actually about a humanoid robot
  with advanced AI that essentially rebels against its creators.
